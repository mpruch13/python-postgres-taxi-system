# cs480 Group Project Application

Should work with Python versions >= 3.8.

The only extra library needed is psycopg2 for connecting to the PostgresSQL database. Just use `pip install psycopg2`, or if that doesn't work, `pip install psycogp2-binary` (I think Mac/Linux need the binary version). If using Anaconda, just `conda install psycopg2` in your environemnt and it should install the right one for your system.

Final version of our CS 480 group project Application.
